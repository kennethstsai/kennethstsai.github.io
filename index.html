				<p id="intro-text">As the urban planner of an up-and-coming city, it is your job to develop this fledgling town into the greatest settlement in the region. Outpace your rivals as you construct infrastructure and draft policies, but be careful not to let your city's pollution grow out of hand!<br><br>*The images here are placeholders because our prototype was delayed in shipping, so I wasn't able to get actual pictures.</p>
